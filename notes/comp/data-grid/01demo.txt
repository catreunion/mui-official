Data Grid - Layout

By default, the grid has no intrinsic dimensions. It occupies the space its parent leaves.

⚠️ When using % (percentage) for your height or width. You need to make sure the container you are putting the grid into also has an intrinsic dimension. The browsers fit the element according to a percentage of the parent dimension. If the parent has no dimensions, then the % will be zero.

Auto height
The autoHeight prop allows the grid to size according to its content. This means that the number of rows will drive the height of the grid and consequently, they will all be rendered and visible to the user at the same time.

⚠️ This is not recommended for large datasets as row virtualization will not be able to improve performance by limiting the number of elements rendered in the DOM.
