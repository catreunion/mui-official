Image list
Image lists display a collection of images in an organized grid.

Image lists represent a collection of items in a repeated pattern. They help improve the visual comprehension of the content they hold.


Standard image list

Quilted image list
Quilted image lists emphasize certain items over others in a collection. They create hierarchy using varied container sizes and ratios.


Woven image list
Woven image lists use alternating container ratios to create a rhythmic layout. A woven image list is best for browsing peer content.



Masonry image list
Masonry image lists use dynamically sized container heights that reflect the aspect ratio of each image. This image list is best used for browsing uncropped peer content.

Image list with title bars
This example demonstrates the use of the ImageListItemBar to add an overlay to each item. The overlay can accommodate a title, subtitle and secondary action - in this example an IconButton.


Title bar below image (standard)


Title bar below image (masonry)

Custom image list
In this example the items have a customized titlebar, positioned at the top and with a custom gradient titleBackground. The secondary action IconButton is positioned on the left. The gap prop is used to adjust the gap between items.
