Stack
The Stack component manages layout of immediate children along the vertical or horizontal axis with optional spacing and/or dividers between each child.

Usage
Stack is concerned with one-dimensional layouts, while Grid that handles two-dimensional layouts. The default direction is column which stacks children vertically.

To control space between children, use the spacing prop. The spacing value can be any number, including decimals and any string. The prop is converted into a CSS property using the theme.spacing() helper.

Direction
By default, Stack arranges items vertically in a column. 

However, the direction prop can be used to position items horizontally in a row as well.

Dividers
Use the divider prop to insert an element between each child

Responsive values
You can switch the direction or spacing values based on the active breakpoint.
